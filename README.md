# Data Analysis | Airbnb Melbourne Australia


<br />

## Project Description

<br />


In this project, I intend to conduct an analysis of Melbourne Airbnb Data. This dataset contains information about hosts, neighbourhoods, room types, prices, reviews, ratings, etc. Through the [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/) website, it is possible to collect this dataset and you can even find Airbnb data for other cities around the world.

This analysis aims to explore the data, perform necessary data cleaning steps to prepare it for analysis, and then delve into the data to reveal trends and patterns. The goal is to provide valuable insights into how Airbnb is utilized in Melbourne and understand its implications for hosts, guests, and the wider community.

## Context

<br />


Airbnb, a global online marketplace headquartered in San Francisco, California, was founded in 2008 and operates in over 191 countries. It enables individuals to monetize their spaces by renting them out to travelers. 

Through Airbnbâ€™s platform, hosts can offer guests short-term lodging and tourism-related activities. Guests have the flexibility to search for accommodations based on type, dates, location, and price, and can even seek out specific types of homes, such as bed and breakfasts, unique homes, and vacation homes.

Known for its diverse accommodations, Airbnb boasts a variety of properties ranging from single rooms and apartments to moored yachts, houseboats, entire islands, and even castles.

By offering unique and personalized experiences, Airbnb has transformed the travel industry. A prime example of this success is Melbourne, Australia. 

This city, celebrated for its cultural diversity, blend of modern and historical architecture, lively arts scene, and passion for good food and coffee, perfectly embodies Airbnbâ€™s ethos of local experiences and personal connections. The wide variety of unique accommodations available in Melbourne further enhances its appeal to travelers.
